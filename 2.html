      Bixby is trained by examples, therefore, it is important to set a good example.
  The information you get in a sentence is called VALUE, while search result is called GOAL.When natural language is entered, Bixby analyzes its meaning and transforms into a structured form called intents.
  Using that intent, a plan is drawn to reach a final goal, and Action will be performed according to an action plan.<br>
  Suppose we proceed with the reservation through a capsule called Space Resorts.
