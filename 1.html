    These are the keywords describing Bixby.<br>
    Bixby is <strong>Samsung <u>own</u> voice recognition platform.</strong>
    Bixby is designed to provide a wide variety of services, closely connected to the user's life, such as business, leisure, and life.
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Bixby’s main feature is that you/ only need to talk to Bixby – Bixby does not require users to use several machines and its assistants.For example, if you say to Speaker, "Hi Bixby, What is the weather like today?" the speaker will answer weather information briefly like, “It’s sunny today”,
    along with the TV screen showing weekly weather and detailed information – This is possible since Bixby works as a bridge to link all required objects.
    Also, Bixby does not directly offer all services to users.Bixby is designed in the form of a cloud-based capsule and learns requests and information from users.
